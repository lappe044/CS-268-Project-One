            <section class="about">
                <p>North America can be divided into five physical regions: the mountainous west, the Great Plains, the Canadian Shield, the varied eastern region, and the Caribbean. Mexico and Central Americaâ€™s western coast are connected to the mountainous west, while its lowlands and coastal plains extend into the eastern region. Within these regions are all the major types of biomes in the world. Epic MT offers three amazing trips of the Rocky Mountains, the Alaskan Mountains, and the Sierra Madre to capture the diversity of North America. Read below to find out more!</p>

                <h3>Rocky Mountains</h3>
                <p>The Rocky Mountains, also known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch 3,000 mi (4,800 km) in straight-line distance from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico in the Southwestern United States. Tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys. In addition, the Rockies house a variety of biomes providing jaw-dropping scenic views. Witness the beauty first-hand via the two week trip up the Rockies!</p>

                <h3>Alaskan Mountains</h3>
                <p>The Alaska Range is a relatively narrow, 400-mile-long (650 km) mountain range in the southcentral region of the U.S. state of Alaska, from Lake Clark at its southwest end to the White River in Canada's Yukon Territory in the southeast. The highest mountain in North America, Denali, is in the Alaska Range. It is part of the American Cordillera. The Alaska range is one of the higher ranges in the world after the Himalayas and the Andes. Denali is six million acres of wild land, bisected by one ribbon of road. Travelers along it see the relatively low-elevation taiga forest give way to high alpine tundra and snowy mountains, culminating in North America's tallest peak, Denali. Wild animals large and small roam un-fenced lands, living as they have for ages. Solitude, tranquility and wilderness await the individuals for this sixteen day trip!</p>

                <h3>Sierra Madre</h3>
                <p>The Sierra Madre Mountains are a mountain range primarily in northern Santa Barbara County and extending into northwestern Ventura County in Southern California, western United States. It is a range of the Inner South Coast Ranges group, and is the southernmost reach of the California Coast Ranges, which are themselves part of the Pacific Coast Ranges of western North America. The Sierra Madre is almost entirely within the Los Padres National Forest. The mountain range is almost entirely uninhabited and composed of sedimentary rock from the Tertiary age. This range is perfect for beginneer and intermediate climbers with a five day trip!</p>
