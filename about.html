             <h3>Our Story</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
  
    

    <p>Epic MT started with two women, a love of nature, and the trip of a lifetime. After graduating college, 
        our two co-founders, Maggie and Taylor, embarked on a cross continental backpacking trip comprising 
        some of the most famous mountains and hiking trails in the world. Their life-changing journey inspired 
        them to make backpacking more accessible to everyone which led to birth of EPIC MT.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission </h3>

    <p>At Epic MT, our mission is to make backpacking more accessible to everyone, from the experienced 
        backpackers to the nervous newbie. That is why we provide you with everything you need for a 
        successful backpacking trip: gear, food, routes, and an experienced guide. Additionally, our backpacking 
        trips are available all over the world: even in Antarctica! From North America to Australia, Epic MT is here 
        to provide you with an unforgettable backpacking experience.</p>
