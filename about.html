    <h3>Our Story </h3>

    <p>Epic MT started with two women, a love of nature, and the trip of a lifetime. After graduating college, 
        our two co-founders, Maggie and Taylor, embarked on a cross continental backpacking trip comprising 
        some of the most famous mountains and hiking trails in the world. Their life-changing journey inspired 
        them to make backpacking more accessible to everyone which led to birth of EPIC MT.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission </h3>

    <p>At Epic MT, our mission is to make backpacking more accessible to everyone, from the experienced
