        Lake Waikaremoana in the North Island of New Zealand. Best for intermediate backpackers, the trip will 
        take about four days, with hikers staying in campsites and huts overnight. If you choose this backpacking 
        adventure, expect to see New Zealandâ€™s forests, grasslands, and stunning views of Lake Waikaremoana.</p>

        <h3>Whanganui Journey</h3>
        
        <p>Diverting from our normal options, our final Oceania trip is a kayaking adventure. Available 
        from late October to late April,  the Whanganui Journey is a five-day trip down the beautiful Whanganui 
        River (the longest river in New Zealand). Starting in Tamarau and ending in Pipiriki, campers will travel downriver 
        into the lush forests of a New Zealand national park. Adventurers who choose this trip can expect to drift through 
        steep-sided canyons, experience unique wildlife like kiwis, fantails, and tui, and take small hiking breaks to 
         cool sights, like an abandoned bridge that was intended to make it easier to reach the Mangapurua Valley Soldiers Settlement.</p>
