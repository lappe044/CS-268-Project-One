        <li>You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a 
            student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website was created for the client Epic MT, a backpacking company whose mission is to make backpacking 
                    more accessible to everyone. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site's webpages must include some sort of headers.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our website includes a consistent header on everypage. The header includes a cool background picture, the name of our 
                        website (which acts as a link to the homepage), and sits above the navbar.  </li>
                </ul>
        <li>Your site must contain at least ten separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our website contains ten separate pages (a homepage, contact page, about page, and a page for each of the 7 
                        continents). Each page has a meaningful purpose. The homepage introduces the company, the about page
                        allows visiters to learn more about the company, the contact page allows visiters to inquire about booking trips, 
                        and each of the continent pages details the trips available in that continent. </li>
                </ul>
        <li>Your site's webpages must include some sort of navigation links.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our webpage includes navigation links in the navbar, allowing visiters to easily navigate around the webpage. Additionally, 
                        the webpage includes external links in the footer to social media platforms. </li>
                </ul>
        <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens 
            should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement separate layouts using CSS 
            media queries.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website supports distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries and flexboxes. For example, 
                    our pictures and font shrink to accomadate the smaller size of a mobile screen and our flexbox layouts (in about page and
                    on homepage) change from a 4 entry layout for large screens to a two entry layout for small screens. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Global style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. 
            Individual pages’ style rules must be placed in a separate stylesheets.</li>

            </ul>
        <li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. 
            CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. </li>

            any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.

            (Links to an external site.) and CSS validator (Links to an external site.).</li>

            Bitbucket, share with the user gomesr-uwec.(Not required for this project but recommended)</li>

        Note! 
Hello Dr. Gomes and Karen. We just wanted to note that we understand the CSS stylesheets is a little confusing. 
We did seperate style sheets for our seperate pages to show that we each contributed to every aspect of the project!
Heather created the styles.css and Alexis broke hers up into multiple sheets. We just wanted to let you know that this was 
an intentional choice.
