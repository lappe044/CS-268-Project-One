        <li>You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a 
            student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website was created for the client Epic MT, a backpacking company whose mission is to make backpacking 
                    more accessible to everyone. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site's webpages must include some sort of headers.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our website includes a consistent header on everypage. The header includes a cool background picture, the name of our 
                        website (which acts as a link to the homepage), and sits above the navbar.  </li>
                </ul>
        <li>Your site must contain at least ten separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our website contains ten separate pages (a homepage, contact page, about page, and a page for each of the 7 
                        continents). Each page has a meaningful purpose. The homepage introduces the company, the about page
                        allows visiters to learn more about the company, the contact page allows visiters to inquire about booking trips, 
                        and each of the continent pages details the trips available in that continent. </li>
                </ul>
        <li>Your site's webpages must include some sort of navigation links.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our webpage includes navigation links in the navbar, allowing visiters to easily navigate around the webpage. Additionally, 
                        the webpage includes external links in the footer to social media platforms. </li>
                </ul>
        <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens 
            should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement separate layouts using CSS 
            media queries.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website supports distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries and flexboxes. For example, 
                    our pictures and font shrink to accomadate the smaller size of a mobile screen and our flexbox layouts (in about page and
                    on homepage) change from a 4 entry layout for large screens to a two entry layout for small screens. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Global style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. 
            Individual pages’ style rules must be placed in a separate stylesheets.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our site maintains coherent style across its pages. Global style rules are placed in a shared stylesheet entitled 
                    global whiel individual page's style rules are in separate stylesheets that match the description of the page.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen 
            readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The site inclues images and each image has an alt attribute describing the content</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Each page must declare its favicon.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each page includes a mountain favicon</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. 
            CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website oragnizes non-HTML resources in folders. Images are placed in a directory named images, CSS files 
                    are placed in a directory named css, and JavaScript are placed in a directory named js. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or 
            any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.
        </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website does not use any libraries or frameworks. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s HTML validator 
            (Links to an external site.) and CSS validator (Links to an external site.).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each page and stylesheet validates without any warnings or errors using the validation sites. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site could be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and 
            Bitbucket, share with the user gomesr-uwec.(Not required for this project but recommended)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our site is stored in a Git repository</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The names of your files should be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The names of our files are entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your content should be neatly aligned. The axes should be clearly visible.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our content is neatly aligned. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our site uses two different font faces. Headings, buttons, and the navbar use Arial and the body paragraphs
                    used Times New Roman.</lI>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site must include at least four webpages implementing some sort of form (or informal collection of input elements). 
            The form might submit data to a server using POST requests and retrieve data using GET requests. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our site includes four webpages implementing some sort of form. The contact-us page, login, and create account
                        all use forms with POST requests. Additionally, there is an input form on the employee pages that accesses the database
                        and allows employees to cancel trips and delete them from the database. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
        <li>Your site must include links to external sites. Clicking on external links must open a new tab or window rather than 
            replace your page.
        </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our site includes links to external social media sites in the footer. The links open a new tab or window. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our source code is readable and uses meaningful names for classes and IDs. For example, the layout of 3 images in our 
                    source code is a class entitled threeImages. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>OUr site includes two new animations. The first is a hover affect over some of our pictures
                    that tells users where the location is. Our hamburger icon also has a new animation where the 
                    links slide out and cover the whole page. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site should be able to use either MySQL or SQLite databases for storing and retrieving data. You could also use JSON format to 
            implement this feature. 
        </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our site uses MySWL to store and retrieve data.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>BONUS POINTS: If you implement different functionality based on login credentials (such as administrators, users) you will 
            be receiving 5 extra points. (Total is 40 points)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our site has different functionality based on loginn credentials. When customers
                    login, all they can see are their upcoming trips. When employees login, they can see their
                    upcoming trips, cancel trips, and access employee links such as timesheet and payroll. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>You should address the comments and feedback from Project 1 in this Project 2.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We have addressed comments and feedback from Project 1. We will discuss this in more
                    detail below. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site's webpages should include a consistent navbar. 
        </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website has a consistent navbar below our header that allows visiters to access all the pages in the website</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site's webpages should include some sort of header and footer section along with the navbar. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The website includes a header and a footer. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Your site's webpages should implement flexboxes/grids or a combination of both. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our website utilizes flexboxes. </li>
            </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>Comments from Project 1</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We replaced some of the images that looked stretched or funky with higher
            quality images (specially on the about page and some of the continent pages). We also changed how soon our layouts flipped to prevent images from looking stretched
            or funky.
        </li>
        <li>We changed the card layout to include space between the cards. We also 
            changed the card layout sooner to prevent pictures from looking distorted. 
        </li>
        <li>We added element shadows to text overlay to make it more visible</li>
        <li>We changed the color of the hamburger element to make it more visible</li>
        <li>We increased the size of the footer</li>
        <li>We changed the color of the guide cards to match the color of the continent 
            they gave tours in.
        </li>
        <li>We added animation over pictures to say where they where.</li>
        <li>We added a map to display trip locations which created a more interesting
            page layout.
        </li>
    </ul>
